<p align ="left"> Learning machine learning isn't easy. It takes a great amount of interdisciplinary work. It's math heavy, it's code heavy, and what's the most amazing thing about it is that there are many resources out their to teach yourself enough to implement just anything you can dream up a neural network for. This explainer is meant to illustrate the math that goes into neural networks. It's certainly going to be in a "discover with me" style, so huge disclaimer on that, but, hopefully you enjoy the way I conceptualize things as I think the math behind Natural Language Processing is super interesting, and almost eerie. </p>

<h1> The DeepMoji Model </h1>

<p align="left">

A good model to start to conceptualize this is the <a href="https://deepmoji.mit.edu/about/"> DeepMoji </a> model, developed by Bjarke Felbo1, Alan Mislove, Anders SÃ¸gaard, Iyad Rahwan, Sune Lehmann. What DeepMoji does is take a sentence, and ascribes the most likely emoji's that are attributable to it.
